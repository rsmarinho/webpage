Assistant Professor with the Department of Electrical Engineering at the Federal University of Paraiba - Brazil ([UFBP](http://www.ufpb.br)). Currently working (mainly) with analog and millimetric waves circuit design. If you are looking for publications, LaTeX, sample codes, or other cool stuff, then maybe you want to take a look at production section. I'm currently with UFPB and PhD candidate at XLIM Laboratories.
